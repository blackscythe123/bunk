# Font Assets

To resolve the font rendering issues, please download the following Noto Sans font files from Google Fonts and place them in this directory:

1. NotoSans-Regular.ttf
2. NotoSans-Bold.ttf
3. NotoSans-Italic.ttf
4. NotoSans-BoldItalic.ttf

You can download these fonts from:
https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans

After downloading:
1. Extract the font files
2. Place them in this directory
3. Run `flutter pub get` to update the font assets

This will ensure proper character rendering across the app.
